        	<h2> Human microstructural connectomics: Computational modelling and validation with histology and CLARITY (MICO-MRI) </h2>
        	<p>&nbsp;</p>
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
       	  <h3>In this project four PhD students will work closely together on developing 
		  models and techniques to create a better map of the human microstructural 
		  connectome, <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> using MRI and histology.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        	<p>&nbsp;Long-range connections comprise only about 10% of total CNS connections. 
			Their arrangement, length, and microstructural properties are of utmost 
			importance for the functional organization of the CNS, because they 
			determine how information is distributed across the brain. In particular, 
			axon diameter and g-ratio (the ratio between axonal body and axon plus 
			myelin sheath) is related to the conduction velocity and thus relevant 
			for the information transfer rate in a functional CNS network. To date, 
			diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI)-based tractography is the 
			only <i>in vivo</i> technique for mapping the structural long-range connections 
			in the human brain. However, mapping from diffusion to fiber pathways is 
			still ill-posed. Tractography algorithms can take "wrong turns" and produce 
			a number of false connections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address this significant limitation, <b>microstructure-informed tractography</b> has been suggested. 
	Microstructure-informed tractography is an emerging computational framework that associates 
	each computed fiber tract with microstructural properties, e.g., metrics for axon diameter 
	or density, using the dMRI technique. However, in its current form microstructure-informed 
	tractography suffers from three major problems:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) to estimate these metrics biophysical models are used, which in turn aim 
	at solving another ill-posed task: relate the macroscopic MR signal to 
	microscopic tissue properties,</p>
<p>(ii) to stabilize the ill-posed biophysical model a lower spatial resolution 
	is required and thus coarse spatial resolution is applied thereby increasing 
	the number of voxels with ambiguous fiber configurations,</p>
<p>(iii) it relies on the untested neuroanatomical hypothesis that two adjacent fiber pathways 
	show less within-fiber than across-fiber variation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this <b>highly inter-disciplinary</b> project, we will develop a computational framework for
microstructure-informed tractography that addresses the aforementioned limitations using
multi-modal quantitative MRI at an unprecedented ultra-high spatial resolution (660 microns).
Moreover, we will develop an advanced <i>ex vivo</i> histology analysis strategy, using
complementary 2-D (high-resolution semithin and ultrathin sectioning) and 3-D (CLARITY)
techniques. We will fuse gold-standard <i>ex vivo</i> histology with MRI to validate the proposed
model at central junctions of long-range fiber pathways within the well characterized human
voluntary motor control network. By emphasizing the close integration of multi-modal
computational biophysical models, advanced MRI technology (the German-wide unique
combination of a CONNECTOM & 7T MRI system), and advanced histological approaches
(CLARITY in human tissue), this project aims at a paradigm shift in <i>in vivo</i> MRI-based
computational models for <i>in vivo</i> tractography.</p>
